/// Situation is a phase during play. It governs which actions are available,
/// and what actors can act (and in what order).
///
/// Situations are stacked on a push-down automaton. [Action]s can push new
/// situations on the stack, which are then processed until completion. Actions
/// can also replace the top-most situation with another one, or remove
/// the top-most situation.
///
/// [Situation] wraps around only two fields: the [id] (designed to be constant
/// during the situation's lifetime) and [state]. This is because we want to
/// be able to implement SituationStates easily (there will be a lot of them)
/// and so we we use composition over inheritance. Inheritance in Built values
/// is especially tricky.
///
/// Situations need to be classes (not top-level fields) because they need
/// to be instantiated each time with actor / enemy / time etc.
